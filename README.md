# Balloon Arena Showdown ðŸŽˆ

Balloon Arena Showdown is a dynamic and interactive web application where users can generate, sort, and burst balloons strategically to maximize their coin collection. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on clean UI design and smooth animations.

---

## Features

- **Random Balloon Generation**  
  Generate a fresh set of balloons with random power values every time.

- **Sorting Algorithm Visualization**  
  Visualize how different sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort) arrange the balloons.

- **Dynamic Programming for Maximum Coins**  
  Calculates the optimal order to burst balloons for the highest possible coin total using a Dynamic Programming approach.

- **Interactive Sound Effects**  
  Balloon popping sound effects are added for a more engaging user experience.

- **Modern UI/UX**  
  Dark-themed, fully responsive layout with animations, transitions, and a clean, minimalistic design.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
- **Design Elements:** FontAwesome for icons, Google Fonts for typography

## How It Works

1. **Generate Balloons**  
   Click "Generate New Array" to create a random set of balloon values.

2. **Sort Balloons**  
   Choose and apply a sorting algorithm to organize balloons based on their values.

3. **Calculate Maximum Coins**  
   The program uses Dynamic Programming to find the best strategy to burst the balloons and maximize your score.

4. **Experience Animations and Sound**  
   Watch the sorting animations, hear the balloon pop sounds, and see the animated display of maximum coins.
